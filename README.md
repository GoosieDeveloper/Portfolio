Hey, here's my portfolio website, let's summarazie it.

I don't have experience yet so I decided to add my strong soft skills & my certifications.

I also writed that my experience is "One year of continuous learning Frontend Development" but ideally there will be my work and position name and dates.

Hopefully I'll change that soon but ik I have to learn a lot but I have time till February next year so I'm not really worried, till this time I should be at least intermidiate in JS.

Why February next year you may ask? beacuse then I have my job practice for school.

Check it out deeper if you want to, 
See ya in my next projects
